# Clock-loader

---

Some websites loads quicker than other, and some of them takes forever to load. So users have to see that boring white page. No matter how efficiently you code the website or how performant your servers are, there will be always some delay between user clicking on the url and website fully rendering on the screen. Between this delay browser displays a blank white page to the user, which is boring.

So you can change this by activating this awesome plugin. This is a small wordpress plugin that displays a clock styled loader until the website content fully loaded and is ready to display. This can keep the user engaged until the website load, so they don't feel bored.
